The FlamePy_sg folder can be placed anywhere on your computer (i.e. your working folder or /opt/... or  /var/temp/ ...)
You need the DL_PYTHON_PATH to be added to your environment, by either:
- Sourcing the text file named Paths_to_source.txt (in /lib) in the terminal from which you will then start Flame.
- Add the path to your .bash_profile (on mac) and then source it in the terminal from which you will start Flame.

Work in progress, first step.
