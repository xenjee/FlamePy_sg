The FlamePy_sg folder can be placed anywhere on your computer (i.e. your working folder or /opt/... or  /var/temp/ ...)
You need the DL_PYTHON_PATH to be added to your environment, by either:
- Sourcing the text file named Paths_to_source.txt (in /lib) in the terminal/shell from which you will then start Flame.
- Add the path to your .bash_profile (on mac) and then source it in the terminal from which you will start Flame.

There is still an error message about yaml but the few scripts in here still work.

Todo: Figure out a better way to import clique and yaml (modules)

Stripped down from previous version (Flame python dev) and with a bit more pythonic structure.
Work in progress, first step.
